<div style="font-size: 12px;">
I am an MA Economics student at Rutgers University’s flagship campus in New Brunswick, with an anticipated graduation in May 2025. My academic interests lie in Macroeconomics, Economic Development, and Econometrics, and I am particularly passionate about using data-driven insights to address real-world economic challenges. I have conducted extensive research on international business and economic development in Africa, culminating in a published article, Policy Semantic Networks Associated with ICT Utilization in Africa, in the journal Social Network Analysis and Mining. Additionally, I have a forthcoming article under review with Information Technology & People. My skills in data analysis and programming—spanning R, Python, and MATLAB—allow me to uncover trends and generate actionable insights from complex datasets, positioning me as both an analytical thinker and a problem-solver.
  

As a Data Intern for Untitledexport Management, a premier hub supporting musicians and artists in social media outreach and label development, I have applied my technical expertise to a range of impactful projects. I designed a codebase using APIs and web scraping to build a comprehensive spreadsheet of over 300 local businesses, equipping the team with data essential for targeted outreach. Additionally, I developed a Shiny application that integrates Spotify, YouTube, and Last.fm APIs, delivering valuable insights to guide strategic decision-making for artists. My contributions also include analyzing streaming data to identify trends, producing marketing insights to enhance revenue streams, and editing short-form videos for social media engagement. Currently, I am integrating data from an iOS application into the studio’s analytics framework, expanding data sources to provide a holistic view of key metrics for strategic planning.
